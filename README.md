## üß† AI-Powered Risk Radar & Sentiment Analysis

The Stock Market Dashboard features an innovative AI-powered "Risk Radar" that analyzes recent news for each stock and categorizes it by risk topic and sentiment, giving you a fast, actionable overview of potential risks and opportunities.

### How It Works
- **News Fetching:** For each stock, the backend fetches recent, relevant news articles using NewsAPI, searching by both the company name and ticker symbol. Only English-language articles are included (using language detection).
- **Risk Topic Classification:** Each article is analyzed using a zero-shot classification model ([Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli)) to determine which risk-related topic it best fits. The system uses full article content when available, falling back to title + description if content is not provided:
  - Mergers & Acquisitions
  - Earnings Guidance
  - New Product Launch
  - Analyst Rating Change
  - Legal & Regulatory Issues
  - Executive Leadership Changes
  - Market Trends & Competition
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Each article's title and content are analyzed separately for sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) using a transformer-based model ([Xenova/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)). The system intelligently combines both analyses, weighting the title more heavily but deferring to content when it shows significantly higher confidence.
- **Aggregation:** The backend returns a summary of news volume and sentiment for each risk category, along with the underlying articles including their full content when available.

### Frontend Visualization
- The Risk Radar displays a stacked bar chart for each risk category, with green (positive), gray (neutral), and red (negative) segments showing the sentiment breakdown.
- Clicking any bar opens a modal with the exact news headlines for that category.
- Inside the modal, you can filter articles by sentiment using tabs (All, Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- When available, article content is displayed below the headline, providing more context for each news item.

### API Endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/:symbol/risk-radar` ‚Äî Returns the risk topic and sentiment breakdown for a given stock symbol.

### Models & Performance
- All AI models run locally on the backend using [@xenova/transformers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers) (no external API calls for inference).
- Models are loaded once at server startup for fast, efficient analysis.

### Environment Variables
- Requires a valid `NEWS_API_KEY` in your `.env` file for news fetching.
